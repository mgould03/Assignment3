2. make your selection using the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4. (You may also use the number 0, but that will close the program) (If you input a number that is not a choice, the app will ask again for a correct selection)
3. Once the selection is made, input the number you needed to be converted.  (For example, if you chose kilometers to miles, enter the number of kilometers you need converted)
4. The app will do the conversions and show you the desired output.
